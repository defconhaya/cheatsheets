**1. Combination (Synthesis) Reactions:**
- Two or more substances combine to form a single product.
- General form: A + B → AB.
- Example: 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O (Hydrogen and oxygen combine to form water).

**2. Decomposition Reactions:**
- A single compound breaks down into two or more simpler substances.
- General form: AB → A + B.
- Example: 2H2O → 2H2 + O2 (Water breaks down into hydrogen and oxygen).

**3. Single Replacement (Displacement) Reactions:**
- One element replaces another element in a compound.
- General form: A + BC → AC + B.
- Example: Zn + 2HCl → ZnCl2 + H2 (Zinc displaces hydrogen from hydrochloric acid).

**4. Double Replacement (Displacement) Reactions:**
- Elements from two compounds swap places to form two new compounds.
- General form: AB + CD → AD + CB.
- Example: AgNO3 + NaCl → AgCl + NaNO3 (Silver nitrate reacts with sodium chloride).

**5. Combustion Reactions:**
- A substance (usually a hydrocarbon) reacts with oxygen, producing heat and often carbon dioxide and water.
- Example: CH4 + 2O2 → CO2 + 2H2O (Methane combustion).

**6. Acid-Base (Neutralization) Reactions:**
- An acid reacts with a base to produce salt and water.
- General form: Acid + Base → Salt + Water.
- Example: HCl + NaOH → NaCl + H2O (Hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide neutralize to form salt and water).

**7. Redox (Oxidation-Reduction) Reactions:**
- Involves the transfer of electrons between reactants.
- Oxidation: Loss of electrons (increase in oxidation state).
- Reduction: Gain of electrons (decrease in oxidation state).
- Example: 2Na + Cl2 → 2NaCl (Sodium is oxidized, and chlorine is reduced).

**8. Precipitation Reactions:**
- Two aqueous solutions react to form an insoluble solid (precipitate).
- Example: AgNO3 + NaCl → AgCl ↓ + NaNO3 (Silver chloride precipitates).

**9. Acid-Base Titrations:**
- Precise neutralization reactions used in analytical chemistry to determine the concentration of an acid or base.
- Example: Titration of NaOH with HCl to find the concentration of NaOH.

**10. Reaction Rates:**
- Chemical reactions can occur at different rates.
- Factors affecting reaction rates include temperature, concentration, surface area, and catalysts.

**11. Reversible Reactions:**
- Some reactions can proceed in both the forward and reverse directions.
- Denoted with ⇌ to indicate reversibility.
