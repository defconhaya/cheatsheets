Cheat sheet for CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment):

**CI/CD Pipeline Overview:**

1. **Continuous Integration (CI):**
   - Frequent code integration (usually multiple times a day).
   - Automated testing and code validation.
   - Early error detection and resolution.
   - Maintains code quality and consistency.

2. **Continuous Deployment (CD):**
   - Automatic deployment of code to production.
   - Ensures quick and reliable releases.
   - Requires a robust testing process and confidence in code quality.

**Key Concepts:**

3. **Version Control:**
   - Git, SVN, Mercurial, etc.
   - Branches for feature development and bug fixes.

4. **Build Automation:**
   - Tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, CircleCI.
   - Compile code, run tests, and create artifacts.

5. **Automated Testing:**
   - Unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests.
   - Tools like JUnit, Selenium, Cypress.

6. **Artifact Repository:**
   - Stores built artifacts (e.g., JAR files).
   - Examples: Nexus, Artifactory, Docker Hub.

7. **Deployment Automation:**
   - Tools like Ansible, Puppet, Kubernetes.
   - Define infrastructure as code (IaC).

**CI/CD Workflow:**

8. **Code Development:**
   - Developers write code and push to VCS.

9. **Continuous Integration (CI):**
   - Triggered by code commits.
   - Build, test, and validate code.
   - Reports issues to developers.

10. **Artifact Generation:**
    - Create deployable artifacts (e.g., Docker images, JAR files).

11. **Automated Testing:**
    - Run unit, integration, and other tests.
    - Ensure code quality and functionality.

12. **Artifact Storage:**
    - Store generated artifacts in a repository.

13. **Continuous Deployment (CD):**
    - Triggered on successful CI.
    - Deploy to staging environment.

14. **Automated Testing (Staging):**
    - Run additional tests in staging.
    - Ensure compatibility with the environment.

15. **Manual Testing (Staging):**
    - QA testing, user acceptance testing (UAT).

16. **Deployment to Production:**
    - Auto-deploy if all tests pass in staging.
    - Or manual approval process.

17. **Monitoring & Rollback:**
    - Monitor production for issues.
    - Rollback to previous version if needed.

**CI/CD Tools:**

18. **CI Tools:**
    - Jenkins, Travis CI, CircleCI, GitLab CI/CD.

19. **CD Tools:**
    - Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

20. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**
    - Terraform, CloudFormation, Ansible, Puppet, Chef.

21. **Orchestration Tools:**
    - Kubernetes, Docker Compose, Nomad.

**Best Practices:**

22. **Small, Frequent Commits:**
    - Smaller changes are easier to integrate and test.

23. **Automated Testing:**
    - Comprehensive test coverage for all code changes.

24. **Immutable Infrastructure:**
    - Use containerization and IaC for consistent environments.

25. **Monitoring & Alerts:**
    - Monitor production for issues and set up alerts.

26. **Documentation:**
    - Maintain clear documentation for processes and configurations.

27. **Security:**
    - Security scanning and code analysis in CI/CD.

28. **Rollback Strategy:**
    - Define a rollback plan for production failures.
